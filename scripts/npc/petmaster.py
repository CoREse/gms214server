                "I know it sounds unbelievable, but it's a doll that became an actual living thing. "
                "They understand and follow people very well.")
    sm.sendNext("But Water of Life only comes out little at the very bottom of the World Tree, so I can't give him too much time in life... "
                "I know, it's very unfortunate... but even if it becomes a doll again I can always bring life back into it so be good to it while you're with it.")
    sm.sendNext("Oh yeah, they'll react when you give them special commands. You can scold them, love them... it all\r\ndepends on how you take care of them. "
                "They are afraid to leave their masters so be nice to them, show them love. They can get sad and lonely fast...")
    sm.sendNext("Depending on the command you give, pets can love it, hate, and display other kinds of reactions to it. "

                "As the overall level rises, one day the pet may even talk like a person a little bit, so try hard raising it. "
                "Of course it won't be easy doing so...")
    sm.sendNext("It may be a live doll but they also have life so they can feel the hunger too. "
                "#bFullness#k shows the level of hunger the pet's in. 100 is the max, and the lower it gets, "
                "it means that the pet is getting hungrier. After a while, it won't even follow your command and be on the offensive, "
                "so watch out over that.")
    sm.sendNext("Oh yes! Pets can't eat the normal human food. "
                "Instead my disciple #bDoofus#k sells #bPet Food#k at the Henesys Market so if you need food for your pet, find Henesys. "
                "It'll be a good idea to buy the food in advance and feed the pet before it gets really hungry.")
    sm.sendNext("Oh, and if you don't feed the pet for a long period of time, it goes back home by itself. "
                "You can take it out of its home and feed it but it's not really good for the pet's health, "

    sm.sendNext("After some time... that's correct, they stop moving. "
                "They just turn back to being a doll, after the effect of magic dies down and Water of Life dries out. "
                "But that doesn't mean it's stopped forever, because once you pour Water of Life over, it's going to be back alive.")
