            "Now what do you want?")

sm.sendSay("You want my story? I guess I can do that...")

sm.sendSay("I brought this expedition out to take a look into the earthquakes. "
           "Had a pretty good team up here before the bugs drove them off.")

sm.sendSay("Of course, we lost a few good explorers when they found out the mountain itself was moving. "
           "you should've seen the look on Thumbo's face... But I don't scare so easily. "
           "I've been studying this mountain since I was fifteen, and I'm gonna keep exploring it until I'm old and gray.")

sm.sendSay("I'll tell you what though, fifteen year old me did not expect to see this mountain start moving by itself.")

sm.sendSay("The shaking was so bad, I thought the whole world was ending. "
           "I saw that big mouth start moving and thought we were all going into its belly, but I think it was trying to say something.")

sm.sendSay("Then it just stopped. And the monsters came... "
           "That's when most of my crew went back down the hill. "
           "I couldn't let them stay in danger, but I couldn't give up either. "
           "And that's my story.")
