No wonder Cutter regards you so highly. My name is Kyrin. I'm captain of the Nautilus, as well as the Job Instructor for Pirates.")
sm.sendSay("Cutter told you that he wants you to become a #bCannoneer#k, right? I agree with him, but I'm worried that your heart might not be in it. Maybe if you knew more about the pirates, you would be more interested. Let me tell you a little about us.")
sm.sendSay("I brought the pirates together to start working against the Black Mage, the great evil that threatens all of Maple World. Turns out the hero business is more profitable than looting and pillaging!")
sm.sendSay("If you become a Pirate, you can help investigate the Black Mage's plots, and assist in the defense of Maple World. Keep in mind that I won't make you do anything...I'm primarily a Job Instructor, and just guide the pirates in a general sense.")
sm.sendSay("But, I know you would help us fight the Black Mage. You have that gleam in your eye that all heroes do. Anyway, I've said my piece.")

    sm.sendSay("Well, that's it! I have taught you everything you need to know. I also gave you a few decent weapons, so make good use of them. Now, go forth, grow stronger, and kick around the Black Mage's minions, if you get the chance!")
