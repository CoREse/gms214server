           "The smaller spirits huddled together in fear at the corruption that held me. "
           "Alone they were mere insects. Together, they could be safe. "
           "The lack of my guidance forced them to coalesce")

sm.sendSay("But this is unnatural, and dangerous. If these spirits were dispersed across the world, the corruption of a few would not be a concern. "
           "But if they were tainted by dark energy in this confined space, I fear the corruption would spread too fast to stop.")

           "I cannot begin to think. If only I had not allowed myself to fall victim to the Black Mage's idiotic plans.")

sm.sendSay("You must help the Stone Colossus regain its pure heart. It would be disastrous if the creature were to fall evil.")
