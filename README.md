#A server emulator for Maplestory.

Acquired from https://forum.ragezone.com/f427/java-v214-swordie-source-1209447/

The original version I acquired has no working cash shop, I managed to fix that. Although you still can't use the account cash shop inventory, and receive failed message after purchasing items, you can now buy things in the cash shop, the purchased item will go to your character inventory directly.

If you missing some files, just go to the link to download the original one, I only changed the src and sql folders.

Current fixes:
1. Cash shop
2. Kinesis skills (because kinesis is the most familiar class for me)

Known issues:
1. Based on the situations of Kinesis skills, I anticipate a lot of skill misbehaviours of other classes.
2. Mob drop data is missing, or I couldn't find them, this original author give drops based on levels, it's working, but not satisfying.
3. A lot of quest and NPC interactions and item interations are missing, for example, you can't get AbsoLab equipments from the shop.
4. ...

You can download the v214 client from steam using [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader), with -app 216150 -depot 216151 -manifest 976750626611673486.

Other things just follow the original thread I put above.
