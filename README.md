#A server emulator for Maplestory.

Acquired from https://forum.ragezone.com/f427/java-v214-swordie-source-1209447/

The original version I acquired has no working cash shop, I managed to fix that. Although you still can't use the account cash shop inventory, and receive failed message after purchasing items, you can now buy things in the cash shop, the purchased item will go to your character inventory directly.

If you missing some files, just go to the link to download the original one, I only changed the src and sql folders.
